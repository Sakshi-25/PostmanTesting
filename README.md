# PostmanTesting ðŸ§ª
Have you ever created a repository via Git? Many times, I guess. But have you **created a repo via calling HTTP APIs**.

### What is POSTMAN?
Postman is a Google Chrome app for interacting with HTTP APIs. It presents you with **a friendly GUI for constructing requests and reading responses**. It works on the backend, and makes sure that each API is working as intended.
Postman is the way to streamline the process of API testing.<br> Download for your OS: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

This is my first repository created via POSTMAN with Github API. We will create a Github Access token, use that token to manage our Github Account with Postman, and then Postman will send request to github.com to make a new repository on the account to which the token bolongs to & hurray github responsed with a `Status: 201 Created`.
